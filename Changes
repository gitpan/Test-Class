Revision history for Perl extension Test::Class.

0.06_4
    -   Fixed bogus heading styles in POD
    -   Test names that default to $self->current_method now replace all
        "_" characters with spaces to increase readability
    -   Documented default test name behaviour
    -   D'oh! Fixed MANIFEST so the distribution actually included the 
        new tests for 0.06_3 and 0.06_2

0.06_3
    -   more POD tweaks
    -   all tests now compile with warnings enabled
    -   test name now defaults to $self->current_method

0.06_2
    -   now uses inside out objects so restriction on using -test and 
        _test as hash keys has been removed
    -   tweaked POD of Test::Class
    -   you can now have spaces around test numbers, etc. (bug report
        and patch from David Wheeler)

0.06_1
    -   removed examples directory from distribution, needs rewrite
    -   removed .svn directories from distribution (doh!)
    -   removed Test::Class::Tutorial from distribution - needs rewrite
    -   removed Test::Class::BaseTest - needs rethink
    -   cleaned up Test::Class POD a bit
    -   documented.t now uses Test::Pod::Coverage if available
    -   pod.t now uses Test::Pod if available
    -   private methods now called as functions to avoid problems
        with subclasses accidentally overriding

0.05 (not distributed on CPAN)
    -   fixed MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP
    -   now skips rest of tests in a test method after first failure
        due to an exception.

0.04 (not distributed on CPAN)
    -   refactored mercylessly
    -   Added Test::Class::MethodInfo
    -   Added first draft of Test::Class::Tutorial. Feedback welcome.
    -   rearranged Test::Class POD (hopefully making it clearer!)
    -   dropped total_num_tests, teardown_methods, setup_methods and 
        test_methods from public interface - they were implementation 
        details that shouldn't have been public in first place. If you 
        disagree let me know (with a rationale) and I'll probably add 
        them back :-)
    -   fixed bug where runtests() could blow up if supplied with a
        non-Test::Class
    -   fixed bug where runtests returned whether all tests had passed,
        rather than whether all test run on test object passed
    -   bug with runtests showing duplicate header lines fixed (thanks
        to Michael for adding has_plan() to Test::Builder) 
    -   FAIL_ALL now exits with the # tests failed (or 254 if
        more than 254 tests failed) to match behaviour of Test::Simple
        et al.
    -   An extra exception thrown after all the tests in a method have 
        run now causes a failed test (to better match the behaviour of a 
        die at the end of a normal test script).
    -   Changed diagnostic messages when exceptions occur to show
        method exception occurred in. Makes tracking failure easier.
    -   Added Test::Class::BaseTest - base class for creating a fixture
        and testing it's of the correct class.
    -   Diagnostic messages improved
    -   Plan correctly shown when setup/teardown method without any
        tests throws an exception
    -   TEST_VERBOSE now outputs a newline before the method name which
        makes reading verbose output easier.
    -   Added startup and shutdown methods after suggestion from
        Tony Bowden.
    -   Added run_all_classes and autorun - inspired by comments from 
        Tony Bowden on running multiple Test::Classes easily
    -   Changed runtests so that it will run all of a classes 
        autorunnable sub-classes if called as a class method with no 
        arguments.

0.03  Thu Jun 20
    -   fixed README
    -   fixed tests that broke now Test::Builder (quite rightly) can

    -   tidied up the code a little.
