Test/Attributes version 0.02
============================

Test::Class provides a simple way of creating classes and objects to
test your code in an xUnit style.
						  
Built using Test::Builder it is designing to work with other
Test::Builder based modules (Test::More, Test::Differences,
Test::Exception, etc.)    
						  
Note: This module will make more sense if you are already familiar
with the "standard" mechanisms for testing perl code. Those unfamiliar
with Test::Harness, Test::Simple, Test::More and friends should go take
a look at them now.       
						  
Note: This is an early release. Things may change. Be warned.
